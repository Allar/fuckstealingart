title: NFT Art Theft Discovery
---

At the time of this writing, Dec 24th, 9:00AM PST, the only way I know how to discover art stolen in the form of an NFT is through services like DeviantArt automatically scanning for your artwork. If you are aware of ways to discover one's own art as stolen, please contribute [to this repo](https://github.com/Allar/fuckstealingart) or try to find `Allar` on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelallar) or in the [Dallar Discord](https://dallar.org).
