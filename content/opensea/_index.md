OpenSea.io is an NFT platform for buying, selling, and creating NFTs. It is home to rampant art theft, allowing many to profit from other's artwork.

## Time Of Writing

This was updated last as of December 24th, 9:00AM PST. This information may be out of date.

## Limitations

Currently this resource can only help with traditional images that have been stolen. I.e. "right-clickable" images. There are ways for attackers to circumvent this but many don't.

## Google Based Takedowns

Filing standard DMCA takedowns and other form of requests allow those who have stolen art to gain personally identifiable information about their victims (a.k.a doxing), while the attacker remains completely shielded and anonymous.

The best way to take down at from OpenSea.io is to, strangely enough, submit a request to Google. OpenSea.io does not host their own images. Instead, they pay and rely on Google to host images. They appear to not be taking any means to actually provide any form of longevity to NFT art. This may change in the future, but for now, here is what you can do. 

### Requirements

1. You will need a publicly accessible link to your work that you own from an account that you own, i.e. to your DeviantArt, Twitter post, Instagram, etc.
1. You will need a link to the OpenSea.io hosted image. Literally right click your image and hit `Copy Address`. If this is not possible with your art, this method may not work for you.
1. You will have to give Google a name and email address.

### What Will Happen?

Hopefully within a short timeframe, hopefully in less than a week (but many have reported resolutions in a matter of a day or two), Google will remove the image from their cloud and OpenSea.io will no longer display your art for that NFT.

### Google Automated Takedown

Google has an automated support system for this. You can find their system at the following link:

https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?visit_id=637756231995447045-4215505887&rd=1

1. Once there, you will need to click the big blue Create a Request button.
1. You'll then need to select the following:
    1. See more products
    1. Google Cloud Platform
    1. Google Cloud Storage
    1. Copyright Infringement
    1. Yes, I am the owner
    1. Image/video
    1. This image is not of myself
    1. Create a Request

You will then be given a long form of information you need to fill. To fill out this information, you'll need to have the requirements listed above.
