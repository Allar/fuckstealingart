# Fuck Stealing Art

This website is a quickly rushed resource in an attempt to help artists take some sort of action against their artwork being stolen and profited from in the form of rogue NFTs.

This is not a pro or anti NFT resource. **This is an anti art theft resource.**

Use the left sidebar to find information about an art theft topic.
